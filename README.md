Tribes: Descend


Welcome!

This is a summer project / side project called Tribes: Descend.

It's a Tribes clone written in the Unity gameengine, by myself, and a select few others, who currently only include Markus.


I don't expect it to be fantastic, but my goal is to learn Blender and Unity to a higher degree.  


Potential features: 

  - Airshots
  - Networking
  - Skiing
  - Jetpacking
  - No hitscan weaponry
  - Deathmatch?
